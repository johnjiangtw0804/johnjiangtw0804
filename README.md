### Hi there 👋
Hello, My name is Jonathan Jiang. I'm a software engineer with a focus on backend development and DevOps/SRE. My expertise lies in cloud computing and backend development.
Right now, I just graduated from SJSU with a master degree in computer science. I'm passionate about building software as it bridges the gap between virtual environments and the real world 🌎

🔭 I’m currently working on
1. I collaborated with my classmates from UCSD on the backend of a social application, tree-hole-backend, which is written in Go.
2. I'm currently learning the basics of React.
3. I'm actively looking for SDE jobs.

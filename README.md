### Hi there 👋
Hello, My name is Jonathan Jiang. I'm a software engineer with a focus on backend development and DevOps/SRE. My expertise lies in cloud computing and backend development.
I just graduated from SJSU with a master degree in computer science. I'm passionate about building software as it bridges the gap between virtual environments and the real world 🌎


I will make an update about my current projects soon...

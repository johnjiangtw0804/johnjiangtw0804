### Hi there 👋
Hello, My name is Jonathan Jiang. I'm a software engineer with a focus on backend development and DevOps/SRE. My expertise lies in cloud computing and backend development.
Right now, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at SJSU. I'm passionate about building software as it bridges the gap between virtual environments and the real world 🌎

🔭 I’m currently working on
 1. https://github.com/UCSD-Socially-Dead-Organization/tree-hole-backend with my classmates from UCSD. It is the backend part of a social application written in Go.
 2. Researching on potential projects...
